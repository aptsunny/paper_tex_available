# Overleaf PDF Render && Pull Request Preview

Created by [Hang Zhang](https://hangzhang.org/).

This is an example project, which automatically render the PDF. Feel free to fork for you own purpose. 

1. Overleaf is very convenient for editing PDF file, but it does not provide PDF preview service. You can use this project to generate an auto updating PDF (synced with overleaf) and link it to your website (e.g. resume). [[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vjrwssthsjzp), [PDF](https://hangzhang.org/RectifiedConv/RectifiedConv.pdf)]
2. Some researchers enjoy using git to collaborate paper writting, but it is not straightforward to preview the PDF in a Pull Request. This project enables this feature.
